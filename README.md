# FrontEndProblem

## Original Problem: 

The Poet

Using Angular if possible or javascript or typescript, complete the following and be ready to execute and explain your work during the interview:
1. Review the  https://poetrydb.org/ api.
2. Write a script or webpage to make rest calls to the server (author and title endpoint) and inspect the response.
3. The script should throw an error if a 200 is not received.
4. Enhance the script to retrieve both author and title by name and log all relevant data.
5. Be prepared to expand the functionality of your solution during the interview.


## Tech stack: 
* Angular App

## Key notes: 
* Created a Poet API service that makes the get call to the poetry api 
* Added in a reactive form to get user input for what author and title they want to see
